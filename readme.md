# Campfire

> A cross-platform voice and text chat app all about gatherings in our 3D world :D


## Completed Features

*Coming Soon!*


## Planned Features

* 3D Audio :D
    * 3D is a bit deceptive, as users will interact with each other in a 2D environment where others' voices are heard from the direction they are sitting away from an individual.
* Proximity Voice Chat
    * Users will experience volume drop-off when others are outside of a minimum distance, up to a maximum distance, where the audio will be cut off completely.
* Voice Interaction through Gatherings
    * Users will be able to create gatherings, which others may join into. These gatherings will distribute users around an area, allowing the 3D audio experience to work seamlessly.


## Tech Choices

Campfire uses Elm for the front-end UI, and supports the possibility of using any other language/framework for the front-end mechanics.
The only requirement is that the platform supports rendering HTML via Javascript interop.
Easily this includes web browsers, ElectronJS, WebView, and others.
